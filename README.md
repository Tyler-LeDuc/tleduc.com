# My Portfolio
I created this website to show off my projects using React, Styled Components and Carbon design. I implemented a dark mode theme and created different pages using React Router to navigate between different sections.
With gitconnected.com API I was able to dynamically load my github profile and portfolio details. This enables me to make updates to the website without changing code or having to re-deploy the website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
